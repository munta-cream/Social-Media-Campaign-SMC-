    <p ><h3>Their words do not define you.</h3> They are a reflection of their own darkness, not a measure of your worth. You are a mosaic of light, woven with experiences, talents, and a strength that shines brighter than any negativity. Don't let them dim your sparkle.</p>
    <p>So, take a deep breath, beautiful soul. Wipe away those tears, not with defeat, but with the determination to rise above. You are worthy, you are loved, and you are absolutely unstoppable. Go out there and let your light shine, proving that even in the darkest corners of the internet, kindness and resilience will always prevail.</p>

    <p ><h3>Impact of cyberbullying on mental health</h3> Cyberbullying has become increasingly common in recent years, and it can have a devastating effect on mental health and well-being. Research indicates that those who experience cyberbullying are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and other psychological difficulties. Furthermore, victims of cyberbullying are more likely to engage in self-harming behaviors, such as cutting or attempting suicide. Cyberbullying can also lead to physical health problems, including headaches and stomachaches. It is essential for parents, teachers, and other adults to be aware of the risks associated with cyberbullying and ways to protect against it. </p>
    <p ><h3>Facebook/Instagram</h3> There is no place for bullying and harassment of any kind on Facebook or Instagram. It is against our policies to create an account, post photos, or make comments for the purpose of bullying or harassing someone else.
    If you are experiencing bullying online, we encourage you to talk to a parent, teacher or someone else you can trust – you have a right to be safe and supported.
    We also make it easy to report bullying directly within Facebook or Instagram. You can send our team a report from a post, comment, story or direct message. Your report is anonymous; the account you reported won’t see who reported them. We have a team who reviews these reports 24/7 around the world in 70+ languages and we will remove anything that violates our policies. </p>
    <p ><h3>Twitter</h3> Being the target of bullying online is not easy to deal with. If you are being cyberbullied, the most important thing to do is to ensure you are safe. It’s essential to have someone to talk to about what you are going through. This may be a teacher, another trusted adult, or a parent. Talk to your parents and friends about what to do if you or a friend are being cyberbullied.
We encourage people to report accounts to us that may break our rules. You can do this on our Help Center or through the in-Tweet reporting mechanism by clicking on the “Report a Tweet” option. </p>
